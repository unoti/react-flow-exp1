# React Flow Experiment

## Project Overview
This project is an experimental UI built using React Flow to create a basic workflow application. The application allows users to add flowchart elements to the UI and connect them to each other, creating visual representations of workflows.

## Purpose
The primary goal is to establish a framework for specifying automated workflows that involve:
- Kusto queries
- Templating prompts
- Executing LLM (Large Language Model) calls

## Features
- Drag-and-drop interface for placing workflow nodes
- Connection capabilities between nodes
- Visual representation of process flows
- Configuration options for each node type

## Target Functionality
The completed application will allow users to set up automated workflows for processing data through various stages, from querying databases to generating AI-powered responses.

## Getting Started
Instructions for setting up and running the project will be added as development progresses.
