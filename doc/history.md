# Prompt history

This experiment was done with Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Claude Desktop,
using the [Desktop Commander MCP server from @wonderwhy-er](https://github.com/wonderwhy-er/ClaudeDesktopCommander/tree/main).

These are the prompts that I used at each stage to create the application.

## 1. Create app
1. [Create application from scratch and post it to github](https://claude.ai/share/7852f674-885e-4c26-826d-b99c16dcc3f1)


## 2. Check in files
2. [Check in the files](https://claude.ai/share/d07834c0-d0c4-4d8c-bb6e-545d56de0e61)
    * This is where I learned that the agent can take a while, burn a lot of tokens, and a lot of false starts to do a checkin.
    * From this point forward, I do the checkins at each stage myself.
    * If I made my own agent, or used something else, I'd prioritize streamlining this process to make it easier.
    * Part of the lessons learned here has to do with file paths.  I was reporting the file paths with forward slashes Unix style
    * But my machine is on windows, so it repeatedly had to figure that out.
    * Later I adjusted my initial prompt in the readme to make it easier on the agent.


## 3. Merge readme files
[Merge real readme with autogenerated readme](https://claude.ai/share/d8878e8f-cbf9-409f-b5ca-9ba0bfa414fd)
> We're working on an application in /users/rilack/react-flow-exp1.  There is both an old and a new Readme file there.  The old readme file has the important content.  The new one is boilerplate.  Can you move the important content into README.md and get rid of the old file.  The updated readme should have the info from readme.old.md.  It probably makes sense to leave in setup instructions and how to run instructions, but we can be brief.

## 4. Visual layout
[Visual Layout](https://claude.ai/share/4828b654-2aff-4bc6-90ec-75dc28379359)
> We're working on an application in C:\Users\rilack\code\react-flow-exp1. Start by reading README.md there to get up to speed. 

> For this step, I'd like for you to make a top level React component called Flow.tsx which will contain our main work area for now. This component should occupy the full work area. Then divide that into three panels: on the left, I want a Tools.tsx occupying the left 30%, and in the middle I want a FlowPanel.tsx occupying all the remaining space it can get, and on the right I want a PropertyPanel.tsx which shows properties of selected nodes. For now, each of these components can just say that name of the panel, which we will fill in with functionality later. For each of the components you create put them into a components/ folder with an index.ts on components to allow for easier import and organization.


## 5. Add React Flow / flowcharts to app
[Add React Flow / flowcharts to app](https://claude.ai/share/32f9facf-9ae7-45c3-afb2-c68a76eb5425)
> We're working on an application in C:\Users\rilack\code\react-flow-exp1. Start by reading README.md there to get up to speed.

> Can you add @xyflow/react to the dependencies, and use React Flow to show a few nodes as an example in FlowPanel.tsx
* I was experimenting with getting it up to speed by having it read the readme.
* I noticed that it was spending a lot of time exploring files and reading files. Burns a lot of time and tokens doing so.
* This got me thinking about the "onboarding process" for new sessions.
* You'll see me iterate on how this works in the coming sessions.

## 6. Adjust to scss
[Consolidate styling and move to scss](https://claude.ai/share/c812470e-ed8b-4e26-b07d-c6baf708b24a)
In FlowPanel.jsx there are two things I want you to do:
1. Move the css styling out to a new FlowPanel.scss.
2. If needed, introduce things into the build and dependencies pipeline to properly support scss.
3. I don't like the copy/paste or boilerplate going on in defining the initial nodes.  Change that into a small easy to maintain list of nodes sort of declaratively, along with something that generates all the nodes to reduce the boilerplate and increase the flexibility.
