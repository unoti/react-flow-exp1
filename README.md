# React Flow Experiment

## Project Overview
This project is an experimental UI built using React Flow to create a basic workflow application. The application allows users to add flowchart elements to the UI and connect them to each other, creating visual representations of workflows.

## Purpose
The primary goal is to establish a framework for specifying automated workflows that involve:
- Kusto queries
- Templating prompts
- Executing LLM (Large Language Model) calls

## Features
- Drag-and-drop interface for placing workflow nodes
- Connection capabilities between nodes
- Visual representation of process flows
- Configuration options for each node type

## Target Functionality
The completed application will allow users to set up automated workflows for processing data through various stages, from querying databases to generating AI-powered responses.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Setup and Running

In the project directory, you can run:

```
npm start
```

This runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

For production builds:

```
npm run build
```

This builds the app for production to the `build` folder, optimized for best performance.
